Both `Doctrine\DBAL\DriverManager` and `Doctrine\DBAL\Connection` accept an
instance of `Doctrine\Common\EventManager`. The EventManager has a couple of
events inside the DBAL layer that are triggered for the user to listen to.

++ PostConnect Event

`Doctrine\DBAL\Events::postConnect` is triggered right after the connection to
the database is established. It allows to specify any relevant connection
specific options and gives access to the `Doctrine\DBAL\Connection` instance
that is responsible for the connection management via an instance of
`Doctrine\DBAL\Event\ConnectionEventArgs` event arguments instance.

Doctrine is already shipped with two implementations for the "PostConnect" event:

* `Doctrine\DBAL\Event\Listeners\OracleSessionInit` allows to specify any number of Oracle Session related enviroment variables that are set right after the connection is established.
* `Doctrine\DBAL\Event\Listeners\MysqlSessionInit` allows to specify the Charset and Collation of the Client Connection if these options are not configured correctly on the MySQL server side.

You can register events by subscribing them to the `EventManager` instance
passed to the Connection factory:

    [php]
    $evm = new EventManager(),
    $evm->addEventSubscriber(new MysqlSessionInit('UTF-8'));

    $conn = DriverManager::getConnection($connectionParams, null, $evm);
