To support a database which is not currently shipped with Doctrine you have to implement the following interfaces and abstract classes:

* `\Doctrine\DBAL\Driver\Driver`
* `\Doctrine\DBAL\Driver\Statement`
* `\Doctrine\DBAL\Platforms\AbstractPlatform`
* `\Doctrine\DBAL\Schema\AbstractSchemaManager`

For an already supported platform but unsupported driver you only need to implement the first two interfaces, since the SQL Generation and Schema Management is already supported by the respective platform and schema instances. You can also make use of several Abstract Unittests in the `\Doctrine\Tests\DBAL` package to check if your platform behaves like all the others which is necessary for SchemaTool support, namely:

* `\Doctrine\Tests\DBAL\Platforms\AbstractPlatformTestCase`
* `\Doctrine\Tests\DBAL\Functional\Schema\AbstractSchemaManagerTestCase`

We would be very happy if any support for new databases would be contributed back to Doctrine to make it an even better product.
